This project aims to provide a comprehensive demonstration of development and deployment processes. It will progressively expand and improve over time.

The project includes a small script that is deployed within a Docker container. It utilizes a service to facilitate the creation and initialization of the Docker image from an HTML file with embedded JavaScript. The ultimate goal is to achieve seamless updates by automatically reflecting all changes upon pushing to GitHub.
